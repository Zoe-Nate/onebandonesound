        HBCU bands today are unique to others and have been more entertaining than ever. 
        From the first Honda Battle of the Bands to today's Pepsi National Battle of the Bands
        At NRG Stadium, HBCU bands have been in the spotlight from all campuses and have become the main meal attraction.
        Their entertainment provides showmanship, musicianship, and high-voltage energy, leaving all they have out on the field every time they touch 
        the field. The crowd went from supporting the football players to buying tickets 
        just to watch their favorite band's field show, hear their favorite song, or anticipate both, an evening full of unforgettable music.

          Of course, When mentioning HBCU marching band origins, you have to pay homage to a key pioneer marching band located at Florida A&M 
          University. Although not the first marching band known, they were the first to conduct a field show in this show-style that exploded 
         a new era of entertainment at sporting events that we see today. Similar to a theatrical performance, a field is performed 
         with a theme and story to tell with music and movement. Florida A&M was not the first field performed, but was the first HBCU field performed in 
         traditional or show-style. Show style or traditional bands are different from core style, core style is relative to more military-based bands that were popular in the past, 
         and "traditional or show-style" is entertainment-value-based by playing popular radio tunes, make intricate pictures on the field, and dance simultaneously on the field.

          HBCU bands, like other bands, were originally formed in the military and intended to support 
          the athletic departments on campus. The only difference was that they were
            predominately populated by black people on a black campus. After the utilization of these bands in the
             the military was no longer needed, their new purpose was to help bring funding into
            their school to whatâ€™s their purpose now today, mainly to help their institution with recruiting, 
            entertainment, and school spirit at events, only with the industrialized competition relationship 
          between the bands recently added.</p> </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
          <h2> 
            Who did it first?
          </h2>
        <img src="32056744-7F51-4F0A-AC4E-2399D7B254B8.jpg"

        width="190vp>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">  In the military, black regiments had their bands 
          since the 1860s and recruited more in their community through performances. Around the Civil War, an estimated 
          200,000 black men were recorded enlisted in the army and after marching band became an important
          part of American society. Although equal education opportunities were not offered to African Americans at the time so 
          black bands were self-taught and were gaining a following as well as professionally taught bands.  
         There have been plenty of black bands going around traveling in their area and performing around in parades such as the 
         culture in New Orleans, Louisiana way before they were put on black collegiate campuses. This era was known as the 
         "Golden Age of the American Brass Band", from 1880 through 1910 started the entertainment factor of a marching band
         and became a part of American society. The first HBCU band was to be known as the Tuskegee Normal Brass Band at Tuskegee Institute
        in 1906 under the direction of Captain Elbert V. Williams. Other bands that we know today followed in popularity later in the 19th century such as FAMU,
      Alabama State, Kentucky State, etc.
